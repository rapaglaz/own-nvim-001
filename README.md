# My Neovim Config

Personal setup for coding and scripting. Nothing fancy, just what I need.

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.11+
- Node 22+
- `git`, `ripgrep`, `fd`

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rapaglaz/own-nvim-001 ~/.config/nvim
```

Start Neovim:

```sh
nvim
```

Plugins install automatically on first run. Takes a minute or two.

That's it. Use it if you want.
